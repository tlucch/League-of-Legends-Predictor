# League of Legends Predictor V1.0.0

## Introduction
This projects aim is to create a classification model to predict the outcome of league of legends games using info from the minute 14 of the game.
Why minute 14? For the people who don't know much about the game, this is the minute in which tower plates (a feature of the game) fall, and this particular event marks the end of the early games and the start of the middle game. So the real aim of this model is to predict the outcome of a League of LEgends game using as input the early game performance of the team

To achive this we have to follow to steps:

* `Data Collection`
* `Classification Model Development`


## Data Collection

In order to get the data we must connect to the Riot API, more specifically to the "/lol/match/v5/matches/{matchId}/timeline" Riot API. With this API we can access to the info of every player minute by minute. This means we can get info from and up to the minute 14 of the game.

Although we can gather lots of information from this API, I decided to get the following parameters for each team:

* **Gold**: Total gold generated by the team
* **Level**: Each player has it's own level, so I decided to get the averge level of the team.
* **Minons**: Minions are non-player characters (NPCs) that spawn from each teamâ€™s base and gives you gold when you kill them. So the total amount amount of minions killed by the team
* **Jungle_minions**: Other NPCs that, unlike minions, dont belong to a team. They also give gold when killed and other temporary benefits. So the total amount amount killed by the team
* **Kills**: The total players killed by the team
* **Deaths**: The total deaths of the team
* **Assists**: The total assists in a kill of the team
* **Towers**: Towers are structures that need to get destroyed in orther to win the game. This parameter count the amount of tower broken by the team
* **Plates**: Plates are a structure that is protects the towers that when broken it give gold. This parameter count the amount of plates destroyed by the team
* **Dragons**: A Dragon is a neutral and difficult to kill NPC that gives permantent benefits to the team that kills it. Total amount killed by a team
* **Herald**: Another neutral and difficult to kill NPC that helps you to destroy enemy towers and plates. Total amount killed by a team
* **Sight_wards**: A ward is an object that when placed on the map it gives visiility of that zone. Sight Wards are a kind of ward. Total amount placed by a team
* **Control_wards**: Another kind of ward. Total amount placed by a team
* **Gold_diff**: The gold difference between each team. If your team has more gold the result is positive, otherwise its negative.
* **Win**: If team won at the end = 1, otherwise = 0

For this project I decided to use the info of the last 50 games played by the top 100 Korea players. To get this top 100 players I scrapped the League of Graph Korea ranking (League of Graphs is a web that shows different League of Legends Stats).

The code for both the scarping and the data collection can be found in the `API-info-colector.py` file.

## Classification Model Development

### Feature Selection
Although we extracted 13 different features, maybe not all of them are really influence in the outcome of the game. Thats why, before training and testing our models we have to select our features. Using the data extracted from the 50 last matches of the top 100 Korea players, which can be found in the `KR-History.xlsx` excel file, a correlation matrix was made, which showed the following results:


<p align = "center">
  <img src = "Images/Correlation Heatmap.png" width = 900>
</p>


Nice! We can see lots of interesting variables correlations between different variables. But our target variable is "Win", so lets see our correlations specifilacy using our "Win" variable:


<p align = "center">
  <img src = "Images/Win Correlation Heatmap.png" width = 500>
</p>


So now we can see our most significant variables are: `Gold_diff`, `Gold`, `Level`, `Kills`, `Deaths`, `Towers` and `Assists`, while `Sight_wards`, `Control_Wards` and `Plates` seem to how almost no impact in the game outcome. So, in conclusion, we can test our models using our original DataFrame with all our features and a reduced DataFrame withouth `Sight_wards`, `Control_Wards` and `Plates`.

### Model Testing

Now that we know our features, we can start training and testing our models. For this project I decided to test 3 well known classification algorithm:

* `Logistic Regression`
* `Random Forest`
* `Support Vector Machine`
